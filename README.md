# Clustering-Breast-Cancer-Data
Abstract:  Unsupervised learning algorithms give information about data without a "teacher". These algorithms are given unlabeled data and use different measures and techniques to extract information about the data. Clustering is a common technique where distance or similarity measures are used to determine if natural groupings occur within the data. We will compare and contrast three different clustering methods: k-means, hierarchical, and density-based spatial clustering and application with noise (DBSCAN). We will explain each method in detail, how parameters are chosen, as well as run each of the algorithms on a real life data set from fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast tissue. We will use different validation measures to compare parameters within each technique as well as compare the three different techniques against each other. Finally, we offer our conclusions, limitations, and a discussion on possible future work and open questions.
